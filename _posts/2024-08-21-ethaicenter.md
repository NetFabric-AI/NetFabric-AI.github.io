Weâ€™re excited to announce that NetFabric is now an official affiliate of the ETH Zurich AI Center! This partnership is a significant milestone for us, especially since many of our team members have deep roots in AI research at ETH.

At NetFabric, we blend advanced AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs), with precise mathematical models. While LLMs excel at processing complex data, relying on them alone can lead to inconsistencies. Instead, we use LLMs to support data processing, enhancing their output with complex mathematical models. This hybrid approach ensures accurate and consistent insights, making our network observability platform more reliable.

As AI is central to our mission, we strive to stay at the forefront of AI research and innovation. Being affiliated with the ETH Zurich AI Center allows us to do just that. We're excited to collaborate as we advance the field of network observability together!
