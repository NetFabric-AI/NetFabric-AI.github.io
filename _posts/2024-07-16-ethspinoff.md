We're thrilled to announce that NetFabric is now an official spin-off company from ETH Zurich. This recognition highlights our dedication to pushing the boundaries of computer network monitoring and IT Operations (AIOps) with innovation and excellence.

NetFabric emerged from the labs of Prof. Martin Vechev and Prof. Laurent Vanbever. Over the past 7 years, they’ve collaborated on cutting-edge research projects at the intersection of networking, machine learning, and programming languages. Our team also includes Dr. Beni Bichsel and Dr. Tobias Bühler, both ETH Zurich alumni with PhDs in programming languages, AI, and computer networking. In addition to our academic founders, our team is complemented by seasoned entrepreneurs who have successfully grown and scaled startups.

NetFabric is based on many years of research expertise at the intersection of the above areas. We are now building the next-generation network observability platform based on latest advances in generative AI and mathematical modeling. The platform will be the first to be able to provide real-time answers to any networking question.

We are excited to be part of the ETH Zurich Founders Community. It's a vibrant hub where startups and researchers collaborate, exchanging ideas that will shape our pioneering platform's future. We're eager to contribute to this dynamic environment and drive significant technological advancements.
